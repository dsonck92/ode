* Mima appears
```
    Mima   : Hello my nostalgia servant. How are you doing?
    Marisa : *shocked* What are you doing here! I thought you were long dead...
    Mima   : *calm* I am dead to begin with, either way I'm here to prevent you from proceeding.
    Marisa : so you are the culprit? then I am goin' to destroy you.
    Mima   : Unfortunately, I am not the one. I'm just helping the culprit to destroy gensokyo.
    Marisa : Can't you let me go as a request from your nostalgia servant, I'm kinda busy here...
    Mima   : I can't. You're going find the one who caused the incident right? The one who's gonna
             break the hakurei barrier.
    Marisa : So I just need to defeat you right? Okay then...
    ???    : Hold on...
```
* Shinki appears
```
    Shinki : Allow me to join the battle.
    Marisa : You again! Gah, what are all the old ones doing here.
    Shinki : I got the news that you are having something with my creation.
    Marisa : Alice you mean? We dont have a deep relationship.
    Shinki : And that is why I am here, to see you if you are having any relationship with my creation.
    Marisa : 2 on 1 doesn't sound good to me.
    Mima   : Dont worry... It should be easy since we haven't danmaku'd in a long time.
    Marisa : I think that applied to you two...
    Shinki : ... Shall we begin then?
    Marisa : You two don't really have patience now, do you?
